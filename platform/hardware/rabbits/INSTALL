RABBITS Framework.


Installation instructions.
--------------------------


To make all necessary installations, just run the install.sh script.

$ ./install.sh

If success, on termination you will have the complete framework available.


Prerequisite.
-------------

<RABBITS_ROOT_DIR>/rabbits_env

At the root of the RABBITS project dir, you will find rabbits_env file. This file
contains all environment variables needed by the framework to work properly. So
follow the white rabbit and fill it with proper values, and then source it.

Platform utilisation.
---------------------

Just get in a platform top directory and compile it by simply run the make
command.

To give you an exemple of how to launch the platform, you will find a run
script.

An example software stack can be built from the soft directory in the platform
directory.



Thank you for using RABBITS.
