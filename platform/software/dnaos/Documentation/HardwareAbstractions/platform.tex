\chapter {Platform Abstraction Layer}
This API is composed of four parts: \textit {endianness} management and
multiprocessor management. Its implementations are located in the
\texttt {pal} directory of the \textit {SSP} root path.

\section {\textit {Endianness} management}
This section presents the elements that allow to deal with \textit
{endianness} at the platform level. In order to guarantee the coherency of
shared data between two heterogeneous processors of a same hardware platform, an
\textit {endianness} property is associated to the platform. It corresponds to
the "official" structure of the shared data of the platform.
\skipon

\definition{PLATFORM\_IS\_LITTLE\_ENDIAN}

This definition specifies that all shared data is of type
\textit {little endian}.

\definition{PLATFORM\_IS\_BIG\_ENDIAN}

This definition specifies that all shared data is of type
\textit {big endian}. Note that only one of the above definition
can be used at a time.

\skipoff
\section {Multiprocessor management}
This section presents the element that allow to deal with
multiprocessor systems.

\begin{function}{PLATFORM\_MP\_CPU\_COUNT}{int32}{1}
	\pin{type}{enumerate}{The processor's type}
\end{function}

This function returns the number of processors for a specified
\emph {type}.
